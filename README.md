# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis<br><br>

## Background<br>
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.<br>

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:<br>

  * Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes<br>
  * Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots<br>
  * Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population<br>
  * Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.<br>

## What I Have Created<br>
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:<br>

  * Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG<br>
  * Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils<br>
  * Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils<br>
  * Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition<br>

### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
The dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using my knowledge of R, I designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.<br> 

### Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis<br>
The dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots. Using my knowledge of R, I have created a summary statistics table to show:

 * The suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots<br>
 * The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation<br>

### Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils<br>
Using my knowledge of R, I performed t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.<br>

### Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition<br>
Using my knowledge of R, I designed a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.<br><br>

## Results<br>

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG<br>

 * Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?<br>
 * Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?<br>
 * Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?<br><br>
